## Here are some common steps for starting your own Python library

1. Create a directory with name of our project / library
2. Create `setup.py` file which include version, description, etc.
3. Create package directory with the same name as our library (`aci`)
4. Added `README.md` file 
5. Added `__init__.py` file which will contain the meat of our code
6. Added `core.py` file which will contain the meat of our code
7. Create a fresh conda environment with the name of your library
